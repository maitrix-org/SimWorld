# SimWorld: A World Simulator for Scaling Photorealistic Multi-Agent Interactions
![Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6246ad14-2851-4a51-a534-70f59a40e460)

**SimWorld** is a state-of-the-art world simulator built with Unreal Engine 5 to generate unlimited, dynamic environments for various **LLM/MLLM + Agent** systems' benchmarking.

## üí° Introduction
Most existing embodied simulators focus on indoor environments. While there are urban simulators, many either lack realism or are limited to specific domains, such as autonomous driving. Moreover, these simulators often don't allow users to dynamically generate new scenes or define custom AI tasks.

In contrast, **SimWorld** offers a **user-friendly Python API** and a vast collection of 3D assets, enabling users to generate realistic, dynamic city-scale environments with ease. SimWorld supports a range of **Embodied AI research tasks** and can be integrated with **large language models (LLMs)** to control agents‚Äîsuch as humans, vehicles, and robots‚Äîwithin the environment. Features include:

- **Open-ended World Generation**: Create diverse and evolving cityscapes.
- **Language Control**: Easily control the environment and agent behaviors using natural language.
- **Benchmark Support**: Evaluate your AI systems with a variety of pre-defined control levels.

SimWorld leverages Unreal Engine 5's **photorealistic rendering** and **physics simulation** to provide an immersive and realistic experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5f43638-7583-483f-aadc-1ddf5d6ff27a)

SimWorld's architecture is designed to be modular and flexible, supporting an array of functionalities such as dynamic world generation, agent control, and performance benchmarking. The components are seamlessly integrated to provide a robust platform for **Embodied AI** and **Agents** research and applications.

## Setup
### Installation
Make sure to use Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
conda create -n reasoners python=3.10
conda activate reasoners
```

#### Install from github
(Recommended if you want to run the examples in the github repo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renjw02/SimWorld.git
cd SimWorld
pip install -e .
```

### Quick Start

We provide several examples of code in script, showcasing how to use the basic functionalities of SimWorld, including city layout generation, traffic simulation, asset retrieval, and activity-to-actions. Please follow the examples to see how SimWorld works.

#### Configuration

SimWorld uses YAML-formatted configuration files for system settings. The default configuration files are located in the `./simworld/config` directory while user configurations are placed in the `./config` directory.

- `./simworld/config/default.yaml` serves as the default configuration file.
- `./config/example.yaml` is provided as a template for custom configurations.

Users can switch between different configurations by specifying a custom configuration file path through the `Config` class:

To set up your own configuration:

1. Create your custom configuration by copying the example template:
   ```bash
   cp ./config/example.yaml ./config/your_config.yaml
   ```

2. Modify the configuration values in `your_config.yaml` according to your needs

3. Load your custom configuration in your code:
   ```python
   from simworld.config import Config
   config = Config('<path_to_your_file>/your_config.yaml')    # use absolute path here
   ```



## For Contributors
### Precommit Setup
We use Google docstring format for our docstrings and the pre-commit library to check our code. To install pre-commit, run the following command:

```bash
conda install pre-commit  # or pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically when you try to commit changes to the repository.


### Commit Message Guidelines
All commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow this format:
```
<type>: <short summary>

[optional body explaining the change]
```
Recommended types:
+ feat: A new feature
+ fix: A bug fix
+ docs: Documentation changes
+ refactor: Code restructuring without behavior changes
+ style: Code style changes (formatting, linting)
+ test: Adding or updating tests
+ chore: Non-code changes (e.g., updating dependencies)

Example:
```
feat: add user login API
```
